## 👉 What is this?

This project is a simple **SlackBot** that integrates with **GitHub**.

Every time that a PULL REQUEST is created, updated, finished, commented or approved, this boot will send a message in a Slack Channel.

## 🤌 Why?

In our team we work with a code-review step.

In this moment, when a developer finish the code, it's necessary that another one review it.

But, how to mantain all PRs and their respectives status stored in one place?

Thats is Pizzaiolo!
